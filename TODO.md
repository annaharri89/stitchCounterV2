# Stitch Counter V3 - TODO List

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Counter UI
- [ ] Rework the UI for the counters so it's more intuitive
- [ ] Make it so the double counter UI will never overflow the screen
- [ ] Make it so the UI is responsive whether the user is in portrait or landscape mode
- [ ] Allow users to upload pictures of their projects progress


### Library UI
- [ ] Rework the library UI, make it a grid list and make images show up

## ⚙️ Settings & Configuration
- [ ] Finish the settings screen

### Theme & Visual Design
- [x] Create a color scheme that the user can change
- [x] Get light and dark mode working
- [ ] Create new app icon

## 💾 Data Management & Backup
- [ ] Allow the user to import export csv files so they can back up projects since it's a local database

## 🔗 External Integrations
- [ ] See if you can integrate with ravelry.com in anyway (sdk?)

## 🛠️ Technical cleanup
- [ ] Dedupe counter loads when opening from library (single, double, row & repeat): remove redundant `loadProject` in `BottomSheetManager`, keep one load in the screen composable, and gate `ON_RESUME` reload so it runs after returning from pause (e.g. project detail) rather than on initial open
