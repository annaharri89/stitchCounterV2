# Stitch Counter V2
This is an app I previously wrote in Java and have now rewritten in Kotlin and Compose.

# Current Features
- You are able to create different projects to keep track of stitches and rows/rounds while knitting or crocheting. These projects are saved automatically when you leave the counter page and you can access them again later from the library page (which is the main page).

# Future Features
- bug fix: the counter projects lose progress if you go directly to the library page
- be able to save photos to your project to see progress
- share your project to social media (can I do this without a server? considering I want to add photos)
- color theme using compose themes
- dark mode
- lots of accessibility features
- allow users to sort by more than project title, more than ascending, also descending
- make it so you can delete a project or multiple projects after confirming you want to delete them
- make it so the user can select if it's "Rows" or "Rounds for each project"
- allow users to add a description to their project/ instructions
