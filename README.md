# Stitch Counter V2
This is an app I previously wrote in Java and have now rewritten in Kotlin and Compose.

# Current Features
- With StitchTr@acker, you are able to create different projects to keep track of stitches and rows/rounds while knitting or crocheting. These projects are saved automatically when you leave the StitchTr@acker page and you can access them again later from the Library page.

# Future Features
- bug fix: the counter projects lose progress if you go directly to the library page
- be able to save photos to your project to see progress
- share your project to social media (can I do this without a server? considering I want to add photos)
- color theme using compose themes, you can choose your theme
- dark mode
- lots of accessibility features
- allow users to sort by more than project title, more than ascending, also descending
- make it so you can delete a project or multiple projects after confirming you want to delete them
- make it so the user can select if it's "Rows" or "Rounds for each project"
- allow users to add a description to their project/ instructions


# TODOS
- seems crappy that you have to leave the page to get the tracker to save.
- style the empty library stuff (make it look like a full screen surface with elevation)
- get it so you can delete from the library.
- update the license with all the stuff you used (google fonts, picaso image loading, etc)
- change app icon to be better
- make an about in settings and include the license and also talk about how this app used to be Stitch Counter and show the old icon
- make it so you can share your projects to social media
- make a new screen that lets you enter a description/instructions for your project and also let you keep pictures of your project (let them know they can have unlimited pictures, but that it will take up more space on your own phone and be harder to restore)
- let them export their library (that they can load back into the app)
- let them export their individual projects (that they can load back into the app)
- provide an FAQ
- add progress bar, description, and photo preview to library preview
- handle horizontal vs portrait in compose
